          <div class="item">
            <p>I'm a full stack web developer living in Dallas, TX. I design and code beautifully simple things, and I love what I do. My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.</p>

            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>For now, it's just me, Muhaimin Jobayer. I spend my days crafting websites. When I started college I originally had the idea of going into animation. However, I took a fancy to web development when one of my friends showed me how he built his own website for his business.  After building my first website, and getting instant gratification of praise from others, I was hooked. The internet was my outlet. A new way to show and share my passions. Now, I’m constantly learning web technologies and other design related topics. I do the work I do because I love it. I like the industry. I love to collaborate with other developers. I believe collaborating with others who bring different skill sets and backgrounds to the table, gives me the opportunity to learn from their experience. I like to make the web a better place. Hopefully we cross paths in the real world someday and we can make it a better place together.</p>
            <p>Outside of work I have a beautiful wife. I love travelling and hiking. I try to take a trip every season. My last trip was in Houston, TX. I go hiking  as often as I can to get away my everyday stress. The more time I spend in nature the more I realize there's so much I don't know.
